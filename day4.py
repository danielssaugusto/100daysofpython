# Sneaky Extra Skill
# You can jazz things up even more by changing the color of the text. Wow. We're quickly approaching the quality of output of a computer from 1981! ðŸ˜¬

# How does it work?
# It's all just print statements, but using special codes that tell your console to start printing everything after this point in the new color.
# You will need to reset if you want to go back and change it in previous lessons.
 

 

# The somewhat random characters in the print argument are telling the computer to change the color of the next text output to whichever color you pick.
# You must add the number from the table below.
 

# Color	    Value
# Default	0
# Black	    30
# Red	    31
# Green	    32
# Yellow	33
# Blue	    34
# Purple	35
# Cyan	    36
# White	    37

# Example
# print("Uh, oh, you've been given a", "\033[31m", "warning", "\033[0m", "for being a bad, bad person.")
# Use that to add extra spice to your authorial masterpiece!
